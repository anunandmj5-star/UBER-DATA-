## Recommendations for Uber
1. **Focus on Business Customers:** Since business rides are more frequent, Uber can create tailored packages or loyalty programs for corporate clients.  
2. **Promote Purpose-Specific Offers:** Many users donâ€™t specify a purpose. Uber could introduce targeted campaigns for meal, entertainment, or meeting-related rides.  
3. **Optimize Availability During Peak Hours:** Morning and evening are peak times, so deploying more cabs and surge pricing can maximize revenue.  
4. **Month-Specific Marketing:** Encourage rides in slower months (e.g., February, March, July) through discounts or promotions.  
5. **Distance-Based Offers:** Since most rides are short (3â€“13 miles), Uber can create promotions for medium-distance rides to boost usage.  
6. **Weekly Trends:** Special offers on Mondays and Fridays could capture high-demand days more effectively.
